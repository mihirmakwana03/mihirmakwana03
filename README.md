**Aspiring Full Stack Developer | MCA Student | Polymath**

## 🚀 About Me

🎓 I am Mihir Makwana, an Aspiring **Full Stack Developer** currently pursuing a Master of Computer Applications (MCA) at ISTAR College, with a strong foundation in programming, web development, and software engineering. I am passionate about creating innovative software solutions and constantly learning new technologies to expand my skill set.

👨‍💻 My journey in tech has been diverse and dynamic. I have designed and developed several projects, including a **Yoga Website**, an **E-Commerce platform**, and an **Online Job Portal**. These projects have given me hands-on experience with technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Java, and MySQL. I am also deeply interested in the fields of history, politics, geopolitics, and space 🛰, which enrich my understanding of the world and inspire my work in technology.

🎸 Beyond the technical realm, I am a polymath who enjoys exploring a wide range of interests. I play the guitar, engage in team sports like cricket and football, and have a passion for digital art and design. My love for continuous learning extends to public speaking, cognitive science, and even the philosophical aspects of technology.

📚 I am also an avid reader, particularly interested in history and personal development. Whether it's analyzing global events or diving into a good book, I believe in the power of knowledge to drive positive change. Some of my favorite reads include books on history, technology, and space exploration.

✈️ Traveling is another passion of mine. Exploring new places and cultures allows me to gain fresh perspectives, which I bring back to my work and studies. I have traveled to various places in India and look forward to expanding my horizons even further.
